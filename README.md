# Digit_Recognition
For the handwritten digit recognition task using the MNIST dataset, I developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using TensorFlow and Keras. The network consisted of multiple densely connected layers and employed the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function in the hidden layers to introduce non-linearity and efficiently handle the vanishing gradient problem. In the output layer, I used the Softmax activation function to produce a probability distribution over the ten digit classes (0â€“9), enabling effective multi-class classification. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer, which is widely used for its adaptive learning rate and fast convergence properties. I selected categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, which is appropriate for multi-class classification problems. To enhance generalization and reduce overfitting, I incorporated dropout layers during training and normalized the input pixel values. The model achieved high accuracy on the test set, and its performance was validated through metrics such as accuracy scores, a confusion matrix, and prediction visualizations.
